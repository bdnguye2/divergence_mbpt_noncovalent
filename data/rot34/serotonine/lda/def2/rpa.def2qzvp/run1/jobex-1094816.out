ERROR in dscf step
Please look at the output file job.26
  Possible reasons:
     - unfinished step before running energy calculation
              ->  call \'actual -r\' and restart job
     - missing input files like coord, basis, control, ...
              ->  rerun define    
     - missing auxiliary basis set if using RI
              ->  switch on RI in define 
     - mismatch between occupation and provided MOs
              ->  rerun define and redo \'eht\' step
