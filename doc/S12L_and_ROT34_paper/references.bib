abstract  ="Molecular crystal structure prediction is increasingly being applied to study the solid form landscapes of larger{,} more flexible pharmaceutical molecules. Despite many successes in crystal structure prediction{,} van der Waals-inclusive density functional theory (DFT) methods exhibit serious failures predicting the polymorph stabilities for a number of systems exhibiting conformational polymorphism{,} where changes in intramolecular conformation lead to different intermolecular crystal packings. Here{,} the stabilities of the conformational polymorphs of o-acetamidobenzamide{,} ROY{,} and oxalyl dihydrazide are examined in detail. DFT functionals that have previously been very successful in crystal structure prediction perform poorly in all three systems{,} due primarily to the poor intramolecular conformational energies{,} but also due to the intermolecular description in oxalyl dihydrazide. In all three cases{,} a fragment-based dispersion-corrected second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2D) treatment of the crystals overcomes these difficulties and predicts conformational polymorph stabilities in good agreement with experiment. These results highlight the need for methods which go beyond current-generation DFT functionals to make crystal polymorph stability predictions truly reliable."}

abstract={Large-scale electronic structure calculations were performed for the interaction energy between coronene, C24H12 with circumcoronene, C54H18, and between two circumcoronene molecules, in order to get a picture of the interaction between larger graphene sheets. Most calculations were performed at the SCS-MP2 level but we have corrected them for higher-order correlation effects using a calculation on the coronene-circumcoronene system at the quadratic CI, QCISD(T) level. Our best estimate for the interaction energy between coronene and circumcoronene is 32.1?kcal/mol. We estimate the binding of coronene on a graphite surface to be 37.4 or 1.56?kcal/mol per carbon atom (67.5?meV/C atom). This is also our estimate for the exfoliation energy of graphite. It is higher than most previous theoretical estimates. The SCS-MP2 method which reproduces the CCSD(T) and QCISD(T) values very well for smaller aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g., for the benzene dimer, increasingly overestimates dispersion as the bandgap (the HOMO-LUMO separation) decreases. The barrier to the sliding motion of coronene on circumcoronene is 0.45?kcal/mol, and for two circumcoronene molecules 1.85?kcal/mol (0.018 and 0.034?kcal/mol per C atom, respectively). This means that larger graphenes cannot easily glide over each other.},

abstract = "The random-phase approximation (RPA) based on Kohn–Sham (KS) reference states is presented as a ground-state electron correlation method to describe the electron correlation contributions to intermolecular interaction energies in this chapter. While originally the RPA was developed to describe the collective properties of electrons in the homogeneous electron gas, it will be shown that the method can also be used with some success to characterize the noncovalent bonding of molecular systems. This will be demonstrated by testing the RPA and several extensions to it in a number of benchmark sets for intermolecular interactions, including small to medium-sized dimer systems. Furthermore, the application of KS-RPA methods in intermolecular perturbation theory, for the description of σ- and π-stacking interactions of hydrocarbon complexes, and their capability to describe large supramolecular host–guest complexes is also highlighted. It is shown that KS-RPA methods can deliver a higher accuracy for intermolecular interaction energies than standard density-functional theory (DFT) methods including empirical dispersion corrections. Due to the reduced computational cost to standard ab-initio wave function methods beyond second-order (in the electron–electron interaction) KS-RPA methods therefore fill a gap between fast but too imprecise DFT methods and highly accurate but expensive wave function approaches. Furthermore, unlike common DFT methods, KS-RPA methods can be systematically improved as will be shown by comparing intermolecular interaction energies from the bare RPA method with two extensions to it which include electron exchange interactions beyond first order."

abstract="This article aims to dispel confusions about the definition of size consistency as well as some incompatibility that exists between different criteria for judging whether an electronic structure theory is size consistent and thus yields energies and other quantities having correct asymptotic size dependence. It introduces extensive and intensive diagram theorems, which provide unambiguous sufficient conditions for size consistency for extensive and intensive quantities, respectively, stipulated in terms of diagrammatic topology and vertex makeup. The underlying algebraic size-consistency criterion is described, which relies on the polynomial dependence of terms in the formalism on the number of wave vector sampling points in Brillouin-zone integrations. The physical meanings of two types of normalization of excitation amplitudes in electron-correlation theories, namely, the intermediate and standard normalization, are revealed. The amplitudes of the operator that describes an extensive quantity (the extensive operator) are subject to the intermediate normalization, while those of the operator that corresponds to an intensive quantity (the intensive operator) must be normalized. The article also introduces the extensive-intensive consistency theorem which specifies the relationship between the spaces of determinants reached by the extensive and intensive operators in a size-consistent method for intensive quantities. Furthermore, a more fundamental question is addressed as to what makes energies extensive and thus an application of thermodynamics to chemistry valid. It is shown that the energy of an electrically neutral, periodic, non-metallic solid is extensive. On this basis, a strictly size-consistent redefinition of the Hartree--Fock theory is proposed.",

abstract = {Abstract Basic concepts and most recent developments of symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) are described. In particular, the methods that combine SAPT with density-functional theory are discussed. It is explained how SAPT allows one to predict and understand the structure and properties of clusters and condensed phase. The broadest range of such predictions can be achieved by constructing potential energy surfaces from a set of SAPT interaction energies and using these surfaces in nuclear dynamics calculations. © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

A theoretical formalism avoiding an overlap expansion and the single-exchange approximation for the second-order exchange contributions is presented, and ways to include higher order contributions are discussed. The influence of the exchange-correlation potential and kernel underlying any DFT-SAPT calculation will be explicated. Enhancements of the computational efficiency through density fitting are described and comparisons to coupled cluster theory and experiment benchmark the performance of the method.

abstract = "The convergence of the intrapair correlation energy for a localized internal orbital is investigated as the virtual subspace is enlarged. At variance with previous investigations of this kind, the virtual subspace is represented in atomic orbitals. This allows to define spatial relations between the orbitals involved. Typically, over 98% of the pair correlation energy is recovered by a small local basis set, consisting of the valence orbitals of the atoms with which the electron pair is associated. This opens the possibility of an efficient Cl procedure based on localized pairs."

abstract = {Abstract Noncovalent interactions remain poorly understood despite their importance to supramolecular chemistry, biochemistry, and materials science. They are an ideal target for theoretical study, where interactions of interest can be probed directly, free from competing secondary interactions. However, the most popular tools of computational chemistry are not particularly reliable for noncovalent interactions. Here we review recent works in wavefunction-based quantum chemistry techniques aimed at greater accuracy and faster computations for these systems. We describe recent developments in high-accuracy benchmarks, a variety of recent wavefunction methods with promise for noncovalent interactions, various approximations to speed up these methods, and recent advances in wavefunction-based symmetry-adapted perturbation theory, which provides not only interaction energies but also their decomposition into physically meaningful components. Together, these advances are currently extending robust, accurate computations of noncovalent interactions from systems with around one dozen heavy atoms up to systems with several dozens of heavy atoms. © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

abstract = {Abstract Coupled-cluster equations for the calculation of the nonexpanded (fully damped) dispersion energy are derived. These equations are solved in the ring approximation using the M{\o}ller--Plesset expansion in terms of the fluctuation potentials WA and WB for the individual molecules. Numerical results of high-order perturbative calculations for the He, H2, LiH, H2O, and HF dimers are presented and compared with the converged results computed using the same basis sets. It is found that the convergence of the M{\o}ller--Plesset expansion of the dispersion energy in the ring approximation is very fast. The padé approximants still accelerate this already good convergence. For all complexes studied in this paper, the sum of the corrections through the second-order in WA + WB reproduces over 99\% of the converged value. The sum of third- and higher-order corrections in the ring approximation is found to be one or two orders of magnitude smaller than the sum of second-order terms not included in the ring approximation and, therefore, may be safely neglected. Thus, it appears that a second-order calculation, which does not require iterating coupled-cluster equations or solving random phase approximation equations, offers the best compromise between accuracy and computational requirements. © 1993 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Performance of this so-called MP2.5 (third-order scaling factor of 0.5) method has also been tested for 33 nucleic acid base pairs and two stacked conformers of porphine dimer. In all the test cases, performance of the MP2.5 method was shown to be superior to the scaled spin-component MP2 based methods, e.g. SCS–MP2, SCSN–MP2 and SCS(MI)–MP2. In particular, a very balanced treatment of hydrogen-bonded compared to stacked complexes is achieved with MP2.5. The main advantage of the approach is that it employs only a single empirical parameter and is thus biased by two rigorously defined, asymptotically correct ab-initio methods, MP2 and MP3. The method is proposed as an accurate but computationally feasible alternative to CCSD(T) for the computation of the properties of various kinds of non-covalently bound systems.},

abstract = {Abstract Some methods of describing electron correlation are compared from the point of view of requirements for theoretical chemical models. The perturbation approach originally introduced by Møller and Plesset, terminated at finite order, is found to satisfy most of these requirements. It is size consistent, that is, applicable to an ensemble of isolated systems in an additive manner. On the other hand, it does not provide an upper bound for the electronic energy. The independent electron-pair approximation is accurate to second order in a Møller-Plesset expansion, but inaccurate in third order. A series of variational methods is discussed which gives upper bounds for the energy, but which lacks size consistency. Finally, calculations on some small molecules using a moderately large Gaussian basis are presented to illustrate these points. Equilibrium geometries, dissociation energies, and energy separations between electronic states of different spin multiplicities are described substantially better by Moller-Plesset theory to second or third order than by Hartree-Fock theory.},

Reliable results on the structure and stabilization energy were obtained for the first two types of cluster as long as Becke3LYP and Becke3P86 functionals and basis sets of at least DZ + P quality were used. DFT methods with currently available functionals failed completely, however, for London-type clusters, for which no minimum was found on the potential energy surfaces. DFT interaction energy exhibits the same basis set extension dependence as the Hartree-Fock (HF) interaction energy. Therefore, the Boys-Bernardi function counterpoise procedure should be employed for elimination of the DFT basis set superposition error. © 1995 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

abstract = { The binding energy of the coronene dimer was determined by high level ab initio calculations. In the first step a potential energy surface was determined for the stacked dimer at the SCS-MP2/aTZ level. The energy of the stacked parallel dimer was scanned with respect to the lateral displacement of the two molecules at various interplane distances, and the minima and saddle points were determined. These results were refined by high level quadratic CI (QCISD(T)/aDZ) calculations. The aTZ and aDZ basis sets employed are derived from the aug-cc-pVDZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets but diffuse functions are placed only at every second carbon atom, alleviating the severe numerical difficulties of the full augmented basis sets while retaining all important contributions. To estimate the QCISD(T) energies for larger basis set, we employed commonly used procedure of adding basis set correction values obtained at the MP2 level. This hybrid scheme was used to obtain the final optimised geometries and binding energies; these are believed to be close approximations to the basis set limit QCISD(T) values. A few calculations were also performed to the T-shaped conformer, although this is less important in the coronene dimer than in the benzene dimer. The high-level results were used as a benchmark to assess the performance of simpler and less expensive ab initio methods for these large rings with small HOMO–LUMO gaps, for instance the SCS-MP2 method, and modern DFT versions that are optimised for dispersion dominated systems. }

abstract="Chemical Reactivity Theory (CRT) contains reactivity indices defined as first and second derivatives of ground-state properties with respect to electron number such as the electronegativity and the hardness. This necessitates use of the Perdew, Parr, Levy, and Balduz (PPLB) version of noninteger density-functional theory (NIDFT) to provide a basis for CRT in DFT. However, the PPLB NIDFT yields ground-state properties which are piecewise linear continuous functions of number, yielding vanishing hardness and staircase electronegativities which do not admit electronegativity equalization. To overcome these difficulties, in the present paper we modify the relationship between CRT and DFT, basing the former on our previously formulated ``atoms'' in ``molecules'' theory (AIMT) but retaining the PPLB NIDFT. We recapture electronegativity equalization through the agency of a uniquely defined reactivity potential. We demonstrate that a positive definite hardness matrix can be defined which controls the minimum cost to the AIMT energy functional of internal fluctuations of the electron numbers of the parts of a system.",

    abstract = { The optimal set of scaling parameters that minimize the error between spin-component scaled (SCS-MP2) and scaled opposite spin (SOS-MP2) theories and CCSD(T) in computing intermolecular binding energies were determined using multivariate linear least squares analysis. Counterpoise corrected intermolecular binding energies among a diverse test set of hydrogen bonded, dispersion, and mixed complexes (S22 training set) were obtained using RI-MP2 theory and the cc-pVXZ (X = D, T, and Q) and the extrapolated cc-pV(XY)Z (XY = D → T, T → Q) atomic orbital basis set series. Optimization of the opposite spin-component scaling parameter yielded the SOS(MI)-MP2 model, with the ability to outperform RI-MP2 theory in obtaining accurate intermolecular binding energies among dispersion complexes with only fourth-order computational effort. At the extrapolated cc-pV(DT)Z and cc-pV(TQ)Z levels, for example, intermolecular binding energies among dispersion complexes were computed with RMS errors of 1.00 kcal/mol and 0.87 kcal/mol, respectively, thereby allowing for accurate treatment of prohibitively large molecular systems at a fraction of the computational cost associated with standard RI-MP2 calculations. With both spin-component scaling parameters optimized, the resultant model, SCS(MI)-MP2, emerged as a highly accurate methodology that simultaneously corrects the MP2 errors associated with hydrogen bonded and dispersion complexes. Computations at the extrapolated SCS(MI)-MP2/cc-pV(DT)Z level yielded RMS errors of 0.31 kcal/mol, and therefore represented a computationally efficient method for obtaining intermolecular binding energies with quadruple-ζ accuracy. With scaling parameters that are essentially inverted with respect to their original recommended values, namely, cOS  = 0.40 and cSS  = 1.29, intermolecular binding energies computed at the SCS(MI)-MP2/cc-pV(TQ)Z level of theory were found to be within 0.25 kcal/mol of the highest level CCSD(T) benchmarks available to date. Surprisingly, it was found that scaling only the same spin-component of the MP2 energy (SSS(MI)-MP2) leads to significant decreases in the errors associated with MP2 theory in computing intermolecular binding energies. These findings, coupled with the earlier work on SOS-MP2 theory, strongly suggest that the MP2 description of bond energies contains a systematically underestimated opposite spin-component and a simultaneously overestimated same spin-component, while the reverse appears generally true for intermolecular interactions. }

abstract  ="A benchmark set of 25 rotational constants measured in the gas phase for nine molecules (termed ROT25) was compiled from available experimental data. The medium-sized molecules with 18–35 atoms cover common (bio)organic structure motifs including hydrogen bonding and flexible side chains. They were each considered in a single conformation. The experimental B0 values were back-corrected to reference equilibrium rotational constants (Be) by computation of the vibrational corrections ΔBvib. Various density functional theory (DFT) methods and Hartree–Fock with and without dispersion corrections as well as MP2 type methods and semi-empirical quantum chemical approaches are investigated. The ROT25 benchmark tests their ability to describe covalent bond lengths{,} longer inter-atomic distances{,} and the relative orientation of functional groups (intramolecular non-covalent interactions). In general{,} dispersion corrections to DFT and HF increase Be values (shrink molecular size) significantly by about 0.5–1.5{\%} thereby in general improving agreement with the reference data. Regarding DFT methods{,} the overall accuracy of the optimized structures roughly follows the ‘Jacobs ladder’ classification scheme{,} i.e.{,} it decreases in the series double-hybrid > (meta)hybrid > (meta)GGA > LDA. With B2PLYP-D3{,} SCS-MP2{,} B3LYP-D3/NL{,} or PW6B95-D3 methods and extended QZVP (def2-TZVP) AO basis sets{,} Be values{,} accurate to about 0.3–0.6 (0.5–1){\%} on average{,} can be computed routinely. The accuracy of B2PLYP-D3/QZVP with a mean deviation of only 3 MHz and a standard deviation of 0.24{\%} is exceptional and we recommend this method when highly accurate structures are required or for problematic conformer assignments. The correlation effects for three inter-atomic distance regimes (covalent{,} medium-range{,} long) and the performance of minimal basis set (semi-empirical) methods are"

The methods, which can be applied to derive binding increments for single noncovalent interactions, start with the evaluation of consistency and additivity with a sufficiently large number of different host-guest complexes by applying linear free energy relations. Other strategies involve the use of double mutant cycles, of molecular balances, of dynamic combinatorial libraries, and of crystal structures. Promises and limitations of these strategies are discussed. Most of the analyses stem from solution studies, but a few also from gas phase. The empirically derived interactions are then presented on the basis of selected complexes with respect to ion pairing, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic contributions, halogen bonding, pi-pi-stacking, dispersive forces, cation-pi and anion-pi interactions, and contributions from the hydrophobic effect. Cooperativity in host-guest complexes as well as in self-assembly, and entropy factors are briefly highlighted.

    abstract="A wealth of structural and dynamical information has been obtained in the last 30 years from the study of high-resolution spectra of molecular clusters generated in a cold supersonic expansion by means of highly resolved spectroscopic methods. The data obtained, generally lead to determination of the structures of stable conformations. In addition, in the case of weakly bound molecular complexes, it is usual to observe the effects of internal motions due to the shallowness of the potential energy surfaces involved and the flexibility of the systems. In the case of electronic excitation experiments, also the effect of electronic distribution changes on both equilibrium structures and internal motions becomes accessible. The structural and dynamical information that can be obtained by applying suitable theoretical models to the analysis of these unusually complex spectra allows the determination and understanding of the driving forces involved in formation of the molecular complex. In this way, many types of non-covalent interactions have been characterized, from pure van der Waals interactions in complexes of rare gases to moderate-strength and weak hydrogen bonds and to the most recent halogen bonds and n-pi interactions. The aim of this review is to underline how the different experimental and theoretical methods converge in giving a detailed picture of weak interactions in small molecular adducts involving medium-size molecules. The conclusions regarding geometries and energies can contribute to understanding of the different driving forces involved in the dynamics of the processes and can be exploited in all fields of chemistry and biochemistry, from design of new materials with novel properties to rational design of drugs.",

The atomization energies were calculated using a modified Feller-Peterson-Dixon approach in which CCSD(T) complete basis set (CBS) limits were obtained using extrapolations of aVTZaVQZ CCSD(T)-F12b correlation energies, and then a series of additive contributions for relativity, core correlation, higher order correlation, and zero-point vibrations were included. The frozen-core CBS limits calculated with F12 methods closely matched the more computational expensive conventional awCVQZawCV5Z CBS extrapolations, with a mean unsigned deviation of just 0.1 kcalmol. In particular, the CCSD(T *)-F12baVDZ and aVTZ atomization energies were more accurate on average than the conventional CCSD(T)aVQZ and aV5Z results, respectively. In several cases the effects of higher order correlation beyond CCSD(T), as judged by CCSDT and CCSDT(Q)Lambda calculations, were greater than 1 kcalmol, reaching 4.5 kcalmol for CrO3. For the 16 molecules of this study with experimental uncertainties of approximately 3.5 kcalmol or less, the final composite heats of formation have a mean unsigned deviation (MUD) from experiment of just 1.3 kcalmol, which is slightly smaller than the average of the experimental uncertainties, 1.8 kcalmol. The root mean square deviation (RMS) is only slightly larger at 1.7 kcalmol. Without the contributions due to higher order correlation effects, the MUD and RMS rise to 2.1 and 2.8 kcalmol, respectively. To facilitate the F12 calculations, new (aug-)cc-pVnZMP2Fit (n = Q, 5) and (aug-)cc-pwCVTZMP2Fit auxiliary basis sets were also developed for the transition metal atoms.",

abstract="Selected points on the potential energy surface for the complexes Rg@C(60) (Rg = He, Ne, Ar, Kr) are calculated with various theoretical methods, like symmetry-adapted perturbation theory with monomers described by density functional theory (DFT-SAPT), supermolecular M{\o}ller--Plesset theory truncated on the second order (MP2), spin-component-scaled MP2 (SCS-MP2), supermolecular density functional theory with empirical dispersion correction (DFT+Disp), and the recently developed MP2C method that improves the MP2 method for long-range electron correlation effects. A stabilization of the endohedral complex is predicted by all methods, but the depth of the potential energy well is overestimated by the DFT+Disp and MP2 approaches. On the other hand, the MP2C model agrees well with DFT-SAPT, which serves as the reference. The performance of SCS-MP2 is mixed: it produces too low interaction energies for the two heavier guests, while its accuracy for He@C(60) and Ne@C(60) is similar to that of MP2C. Fitting formulas for the main interaction energy components, i.e. the dispersion and first-order repulsion energies are proposed, which are applicable for both endo- and exohedral cases. For all examined methods density fitting is used to evaluate two-electron repulsion integrals, which is indispensable to allow studies of noncovalent complexes of this size. It has been found that density-fitting auxiliary basis sets cannot be used in a black-box fashion for the calculation of the first-order SAPT electrostatic energy, and that the quality of these basis sets should be always carefully examined in order to avoid an unphysical long-range behavior.",

abstract="We derive a renormalized many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) starting from the random phase approximation (RPA). This RPA-renormalized perturbation theory extends the scope of single-reference MBPT methods to small-gap systems without significantly increasing the computational cost. The leading correction to RPA, termed the approximate exchange kernel (AXK), substantially improves upon RPA atomization energies and ionization potentials without affecting other properties such as barrier heights where RPA is already accurate. Thus, AXK is more balanced than second-order screened exchange [A. Gruneis et al., J. Chem. Phys. 131, 154115 (2009)], which tends to overcorrect RPA for systems with stronger static correlation. Similarly, AXK avoids the divergence of second-order M{\o}ller--Plesset (MP2) theory for small gap systems and delivers a much more consistent performance than MP2 across the periodic table at comparable cost. RPA+AXK thus is an accurate, non-empirical, and robust tool to assess and improve semi-local density functional theory for a wide range of systems previously inaccessible to first-principles electronic structure calculations.",

This is achieved by adding a correction term to the supermolecular MP2 energy that is determined using time-dependent density functional (TDDFT) response theory and that accounts for the error of the dispersion energy contained in the supermolecular MP2 method. It is shown for the S22 database set of noncovalent complexes and some potential energy curves of noncovalent bound aromatic dimers that the approach gives strong improvements over MP2 if compared to coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) reference energies. An efficient computer implementation of the method is presented that is shown to scale only with the fourth power of the system size and thus leads only to a slightly higher computational cost than that of the supermolecular MP2 itself.",

Two different model potential approaches, one using quantum Drude oscillators and the other using polarization potentials, are investigated for describing the long-range correlation effects between the weakly bound excess electron and the more tightly bound electrons of the monomers. We show that these two approaches are related in that the polarization potential models can be derived from the quantum Drude model approach by use of an adiabatic separation between the excess electron and the Drude oscillators. The model potential approaches are applied to clusters containing up to 45 water monomers. Where possible, comparison is made with the results of ab initio electronic structure calculations. Overall, the polarization potential approach is found to give electron binding energies in good agreement with those from the Drude model and ab initio calculations, with the greatest discrepancies being found for {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}cavity-bound{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} anion states.",

abstract="Van der Waals (vdW) interactions are ubiquitous in molecules and condensed matter, and play a crucial role in determining the structure, stability, and function for a wide variety of systems. The accurate prediction of these interactions from first principles is a substantial challenge because they are inherently quantum mechanical phenomena that arise from correlations between many electrons within a given molecular system. We introduce an efficient method that accurately describes the nonadditive many-body vdW energy contributions arising from interactions that cannot be modeled by an effective pairwise approach, and demonstrate that such contributions can significantly exceed the energy of thermal fluctuations--a critical accuracy threshold highly coveted during molecular simulations--in the prediction of several relevant properties. Cases studied include the binding affinity of ellipticine, a DNA-intercalating anticancer agent, the relative energetics between the A- and B-conformations of DNA, and the thermodynamic stability among competing paracetamol molecular crystal polymorphs. Our findings suggest that inclusion of the many-body vdW energy is essential for achieving chemical accuracy and therefore must be accounted for in molecular simulations.",

                   al., J. Chem. Phys. 139, 094105 (2013)]. The approach
                   extensively uses local natural orbitals to reduce the

                   correlation domains. In addition, we also demonstrate

abstract="A new density functional (DF) of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) type for general chemistry applications termed B97-D is proposed. It is based on Becke{\textquoteright}s power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parameterized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C(6) x R(-6). A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common density functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported. The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on standard thermochemical benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked aromatic molecules and group II element clusters, and for the computation of molecular geometries. Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for standard functionals. In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean absolute deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol(-1). The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the average CCSD(T) accuracy. The basic strategy in the development to restrict the density functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interatomic distances by damped C(6) x R(-6) terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions. As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient and accurate quantum chemical method for large systems where dispersion forces are of general importance.",

The most important types of non-covalent complexes are classified and several small and medium size non-covalent systems, including H-bonded and improper H-bonded complexes, nucleic acid base pairs, and peptides and proteins are discussed with some detail.

abstract="he simplest way to predict London dispersion energies involving complex multiatom objects is to add separate contributions from each pair of atoms. Semiempirical, and even certain less empirical, ways to do this can be very efficient computationally and have recently been developed to a high level of sophistication, with considerable success. There are, however, effects that are not captured in this way, including surprising dependences of the dispersion energy on the number N of atoms and on separation D. Higher level quantum chemical, perturbative, and random-phase approximation (RPA)-like theories can capture these beyond pairwise effects, but at a high computational cost. Very recent simplified RPA-like approaches based on localized oscillators account for the unusual N dependence in a computationally efficient way. To proceed further, the present work proposes three physically distinct categories of nonpairwise effects (types A, B, and C) against which the performance of existing and future theories can be assessed.",

abstract="The strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) semilocal density functional [J. Sun, A. Ruzsinszky, and J. P. Perdew, Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 036402 (2015)] obeys all 17 known exact constraints for meta-generalized-gradient approximations (meta-GGAs), and it includes some medium-range correlation effects. Long-range London dispersion interactions are still missing, but they can be accounted for via an appropriate correction scheme. In this study, we combine SCAN with an efficient London dispersion correction and show that lattice energies of simple organic crystals can be improved with the applied correction by 50\%. The London-dispersion corrected SCAN meta-GGA outperforms all other tested London-dispersion corrected meta-GGAs for molecular geometries. Our method yields mean absolute deviations (MADs) for main group bond lengths that are consistently below 1 pm, rotational constants with MADs of 0.2\%, and noncovalent distances with MADs below 1\%. For a large database of general main group thermochemistry and kinetics (\~{}800 chemical species), one of the lowest weighted mean absolute deviations for long-range corrected meta-GGA functionals is achieved. Noncovalent interactions are of average quality, and hydrogen bonded systems in particular seem to suffer from overestimated polarization related to the self-interaction error of SCAN. We also discuss some consequences of numerical sensitivity encountered for meta-GGAs.",

We present the theoretical background of RPA in an intuitive rather than formal fashion, focusing on the physical picture of screening and simple diagrammatic analysis. A new decomposition of the RPA correlation energy into plasmonic modes leads to an appealing visualization of electron correlation in terms of charge density fluctuations. Recent developments in the areas of beyond-RPA methods, RPA correlation potentials, and efficient algorithms for RPA energy and property calculations are reviewed. The ability of RPA to approximately capture static correlation in molecules is quantified by an analysis of RPA natural occupation numbers. We illustrate the use of RPA methods in applications to small-gap systems such as open-shell d- and f-element compounds, radicals, and weakly bound complexes, where semilocal density functional results exhibit strong functional dependence.",

    abstract="The random phase approximation (RPA) to the density functional correlation energy systematically improves upon many limitations of present semilocal functionals, but was considered too computationally expensive for widespread use in the past. Here a physically appealing reformulation of the RPA correlation model is developed that substantially reduces its computational complexity. The density functional RPA correlation energy is shown to equal one-half times the difference of all RPA electronic excitation energies computed at full and first order coupling. Thus, the RPA correlation energy may be considered as a difference of electronic zero point vibrational energies, where each eigenmode corresponds to an electronic excitation. This surprisingly simple result is intimately related to plasma theories of electron correlation. Differences to electron pair correlation models underlying popular correlated wave function methods are discussed. The RPA correlation energy is further transformed into an explicit functional of the Kohn-Sham orbitals. The only nontrivial ingredient to this functional is the sign function of the response operator. A stable iterative algorithm to evaluate this sign function based on the Newton-Schulz iteration is presented. Integral direct implementations scale as the fifth power of the system size, similar to second order M{\o}ller--Plesset calculations. With these improvements, RPA may become the long-sought robust and efficient zero order post-Kohn-Sham correlation model.",

abstract="In the past decade, the random phase approximation (RPA) has emerged as a promising post-Kohn--Sham method to treat electron correlation in molecules, surfaces, and solids. In this review, we explain how RPA arises naturally as a zero-order approximation from the adiabatic connection and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem in a density functional context. This is contrasted to RPA with exchange (RPAX) in a post-Hartree--Fock context. In both methods, RPA and RPAX, the correlation energy may be expressed as a sum over zero-point energies of harmonic oscillators representing collective electronic excitations, consistent with the physical picture originally proposed by Bohm and Pines. The extra factor 1/2 in the RPAX case is rigorously derived. Approaches beyond RPA are briefly summarized. We also review computational strategies implementing RPA. The combination of auxiliary expansions and imaginary frequency integration methods has lead to recent progress in this field, making RPA calculations affordable for systems with over 100 atoms. Finally, we summarize benchmark applications of RPA to various molecular and solid-state properties, including relative energies of conformers, reaction energies involving weak and covalent interactions, diatomic potential energy curves, ionization potentials and electron affinities, surface adsorption energies, bulk cohesive energies and lattice constants. RPA barrier heights for an extended benchmark set are presented. RPA is an order of magnitude more accurate than semi-local functionals such as B3LYP for non-covalent interactions rivaling the best empirically parametrized methods. Larger but systematic errors are observed for processes that do not conserve the number of electron pairs, such as atomization and ionization.",

This range-separated TDDFT tends to give underestimated C6 coefficients of small molecules with a mean absolute percentage error of about 5\%, a slight improvement over standard TDDFT in the adiabatic LDA which tends to overestimate them with a mean absolute percentage error of 8\%, but close to time-dependent Hartree-Fock which has a mean absolute percentage error of about 6\%. These results thus show that introduction of long-range HF exchange in TDDFT has a small but beneficial impact on the values of C6 coefficients. It also confirms that the present variant of range-separated TDDFT is a reasonably accurate method even using only a LDA-type density functional and without adding an explicit treatment of long-range correlation.",

abstract="A self-consistent Kohn-Sham (KS) method is presented that treats correlation on the basis of the adiabatic-connection dissipation-fluctuation theorem employing the direct random phase approximation (dRPA), i.e., taking into account only the Coulomb kernel while neglecting the exchange-correlation kernel in the calculation of the Kohn-Sham correlation energy and potential. The method, denoted self-consistent dRPA method, furthermore treats exactly the exchange energy and the local multiplicative KS exchange potential. It uses Gaussian basis sets, is reasonably efficient, exhibiting a scaling of the computational effort with the forth power of the system size, and thus is generally applicable to molecules. The resulting dRPA correlation potentials in contrast to common approximate correlation potentials are in good agreement with exact reference potentials. The negatives of the eigenvalues of the highest occupied molecular orbitals are found to be in good agreement with experimental ionization potentials. Total energies from self-consistent dRPA calculations, as expected, are even poorer than non-self-consistent dRPA total energies and dRPA reaction and non-covalent binding energies do not significantly benefit from self-consistency. On the other hand, energies obtained with a recently introduced adiabatic-connection dissipation-fluctuation approach (EXXRPA+, exact-exchange random phase approximation) that takes into account, besides the Coulomb kernel, also the exact frequency-dependent exchange kernel are significantly improved if evaluated with orbitals obtained from a self-consistent dRPA calculation instead of an exact exchange-only calculation. Total energies, reaction energies, and noncovalent binding energies obtained in this way are of the same quality as those of high-level quantum chemistry methods, like the coupled cluster singles doubles method which is computationally more demanding.",

abstract="The structural properties of graphite, such as the interlayer equilibrium distance, the elastic constant, and the net layer binding energy, are obtained using the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem in the random phase approximation. Excellent agreement is found with the available experimental data; however, our computed binding energy of 48 meV per atom is somewhat smaller than the one obtained by quantum Monte Carlo methods. The asymptotic behavior of the interlayer dispersion interaction, previously derived from analytic approximations, is explicitly demonstrated to follow a d-3 behavior at very large distances.",

abstract="We present a revised form of a double hybrid density functional (DHDF) dubbed PWRB95. It contains semi-local Perdew-Wang exchange and Becke95 correlation with a fixed amount of 50\% non-local Fock exchange. New features are that the robust random phase approximation (RPA) is used to calculate the non-local correlation part instead of a second-order perturbative treatment as in standard DHDF, and the non-self-consistent evaluation of the Fock exchange with KS-orbitals at the GGA level which leads to a significant reduction of the computational effort. To account for London dispersion effects we include the non-local VV10 dispersion functional. Only three empirical scaling parameters were adjusted. The PWRB95 results for extensive standard thermochemical benchmarks (GMTKN30 data base) are compared to those of well-known functionals from the classes of (meta-)GGAs, (meta-)hybrid functionals, and DHDFs, as well as to standard (direct) RPA. The new method is furthermore tested on prototype bond activations with (Ni/Pd)-based transition metal catalysts, and two difficult cases for DHDF, namely the isomerization reaction of the [Cu2(en)2O2](2+) complex and the singlet-triplet energy difference in highly unsaturated cyclacenes. The results show that PWRB95 is almost as accurate as standard DHDF for main-group thermochemistry but has a similar or better performance for non-covalent interactions, more difficult transition metal containing molecules and other electronically problematic cases. Because of its relatively weak basis set dependence, PWRB95 can be applied even in combination with AO basis sets of only triple-zeta quality which yields huge overall computational savings by a factor of about 40 compared to standard DHDF/{\textquoteright}quadruple-zeta{\textquoteright} calculations. Structure optimizations of small molecules with PWRB95 indicate an accurate description of bond distances superior to that provided by TPSS-D3, PBE0-D3, or other RPA type methods.",

title="An efficient and near linear scaling pair natural orbital based local coupled cluster method",
journal="J. Chem. Phys.",

volume="138",
number="3",
pages="034106",
optkeywords="myref",
abstract="In previous publications, it was shown that an efficient local coupled cluster method with single- and double excitations can be based on the concept of pair natural orbitals (PNOs) [F. Neese, A. Hansen, and D. G. Liakos, J. Chem. Phys. 131, 064103 (2009)]. The resulting local pair natural orbital-coupled-cluster single double (LPNO-CCSD) method has since been proven to be highly reliable and efficient. For large molecules, the number of amplitudes to be determined is reduced by a factor of 10(5)-10(6) relative to a canonical CCSD calculation on the same system with the same basis set. In the original method, the PNOs were expanded in the set of canonical virtual orbitals and single excitations were not truncated. This led to a number of fifth order scaling steps that eventually rendered the method computationally expensive for large molecules (e.g., >100 atoms). In the present work, these limitations are overcome by a complete redesign of the LPNO-CCSD method. The new method is based on the combination of the concepts of PNOs and projected atomic orbitals (PAOs). Thus, each PNO is expanded in a set of PAOs that in turn belong to a given electron pair specific domain. In this way, it is possible to fully exploit locality while maintaining the extremely high compactness of the original LPNO-CCSD wavefunction. No terms are dropped from the CCSD equations and domains are chosen conservatively. The correlation energy loss due to the domains remains below <0.05\%, which implies typically 15-20 but occasionally up to 30 atoms per domain on average. The new method has been given the acronym DLPNO-CCSD ({\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}domain based LPNO-CCSD{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright}). The method is nearly linear scaling with respect to system size. The original LPNO-CCSD method had three adjustable truncation thresholds that were chosen conservatively and do not need to be changed for actual applications. In the present treatment, no additional truncation parameters have been introduced. Any additional truncation is performed on the basis of the three original thresholds. There are no real-space cutoffs. Single excitations are truncated using singles-specific natural orbitals. Pairs are prescreened according to a multipole expansion of a pair correlation energy estimate based on local orbital specific virtual orbitals (LOSVs). Like its LPNO-CCSD predecessor, the method is completely of black box character and does not require any user adjustments. It is shown here that DLPNO-CCSD is as accurate as LPNO-CCSD while leading to computational savings exceeding one order of magnitude for larger systems. The largest calculations reported here featured >8800 basis functions and >450 atoms. In all larger test calculations done so far, the LPNO-CCSD step took less time than the preceding Hartree-Fock calculation, provided no approximations have been introduced in the latter. Thus, based on the present development reliable CCSD calculations on large molecules with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy are realized.",

abstract="An improved version of our general-order local coupled-cluster (CC) approach [Z. Rolik and M. Kallay, J. Chem. Phys. 135, 104111 (2011)] and its efficient implementation at the CC singles and doubles with perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] level is presented. The method combines the cluster-in-molecule approach of Li and co-workers [J. Chem. Phys. 131, 114109 (2009)] with frozen natural orbital (NO) techniques. To break down the unfavorable fifth-power scaling of our original approach a two-level domain construction algorithm has been developed. First, an extended domain of localized molecular orbitals (LMOs) is assembled based on the spatial distance of the orbitals. The necessary integrals are evaluated and transformed in these domains invoking the density fitting approximation. In the second step, for each occupied LMO of the extended domain a local subspace of occupied and virtual orbitals is constructed including approximate second-order M{\o}ller--Plesset NOs. The CC equations are solved and the perturbative corrections are calculated in the local subspace for each occupied LMO using a highly-efficient CCSD(T) code, which was optimized for the typical sizes of the local subspaces. The total correlation energy is evaluated as the sum of the individual contributions. The computation time of our approach scales linearly with the system size, while its memory and disk space requirements are independent thereof. Test calculations demonstrate that currently our method is one of the most efficient local CCSD(T) approaches and can be routinely applied to molecules of up to 100 atoms with reasonable basis sets.",

abstract="For many years, MP2 served as the principal method for the treatment of noncovalent interactions. Until recently, this was the only technique that could be used to produce reasonably accurate binding energies, with binding energy errors generally below \~{}35\%, at a reasonable computational cost. The past decade has seen the development of many new methods with improved performance for noncovalent interactions, several of which are based on MP2. Here, we assess the performance of MP2, LMP2, MP2-F12, and LMP2-F12, as well as spin component scaled variants (SCS) of these methods, in terms of their abilities to produce accurate interaction energies for binding motifs commonly found in organic and biomolecular systems. Reference data from the newly developed S66 database of interaction energies are used for this assessment, and a further set of 38 complexes is used as a test set for SCS methods developed herein. The strongly basis set-dependent nature of MP2 is confirmed in this study, with the SCS technique greatly reducing this behavior. It is found in this work that the spin component scaling technique can effectively be used to dramatically improve the performance of MP2 and MP2 variants, with overall errors being reduced by factors of about 1.5--2. SCS versions of all MP2 variants tested here are shown to give similarly accurate overall results.",

Our dynamic polarizabilities (dipole, quadrupole, octupole, etc.) are exact in the zero- and high-frequency limits, and exact at all frequencies for a metallic sphere of uniform density. Our theory predicts dynamic multipole polarizabilities in excellent agreement with more expensive many-body methods, and yields therefrom vdW coefficients C(6), C(8), C(10) for atom pairs with a mean absolute relative error of only 3\%.",

abstract="Dispersion interactions play a crucial role in noncovalently bound molecular systems, and recent studies have shown that dispersion effects are also critical for accurately describing covalently bound solids. While most studies on bulk solids have solely focused on equilibrium properties (lattice constants, bulk moduli, and cohesive energies), there has been little work on assessing the importance of dispersion effects for solid-state properties far from equilibrium. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of both equilibrium and highly nonequilibrium properties (tensile strengths leading to fracture) of various palladium-hydride systems using representative DFT methods within the LDA, GGA, DFT-D2, DFT-D3, and nonlocal vdw-DFT families. Among the various DFT methods, we surprisingly find that the empirically constructed DFT-D2 functional gives extremely anomalous and qualitatively incorrect results for tensile strengths in palladium-hydride bulk solids. We present a detailed analysis of these effects and discuss the ramifications of using these methods for predicting solid-state properties far from equilibrium. Most importantly, we suggest caution in using DFT-D2 (or other coarse-grained parametrizations obtained from DFT-D2) for computing material properties under large stress/strain loads or for evaluating solid-state properties under extreme structural conditions.",

abstract="One- and two-color, mass-selected R2PI spectra of the S1{\textleftarrow}S0 transitions in the bare chiral chromophore R-(+)-1-phenyl-1-propanol (R) and its complexes with a variety of alcoholic solvent molecules (solv), namely methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, S-(+)-2-butanol, R-(-)-2-butanol, 1-pentanol, S-(+)-2-pentanol, R-(-)-2-pentanol, and 3-pentanol, were recorded after a supersonic molecular beam expansion. Spectral analysis, coupled with theoretical calculations, indicate that several hydrogen-bonded [R.solv] conformers are present in the beam. The R2PI excitation spectra of [R.solv] are characterized by significant shifts of their band origin relative to that of bare R. The extent and direction of these spectral shifts depend on the structure and configuration of solv and are attributed to different short-range interactions in the ground and excited [R.solv] complexes. Measurement of the binding energies of [R.solv] in their neutral and ionic states points to a subtle balance between attractive (electrostatic and dispersive) and repulsive (steric) forces, which control the spectral features of the complexes and allow enantiomeric discrimination of chiral solv molecules.",

Interactions of TPPS with tripeptide, hexapeptide, and PL containing about ten amino acid residues in the molecular chain are accompanied with the changes of VCD patterns in the amide I{\textasciiacutex} region. In these cases, the conformation of the oligopeptide part of complexes is obviously influenced by interactions with TPPS and partial changes of random coil structure are observed in VCD. When PL was composed of the hundreds of lysine residues, just a weak intensity decrease was detected and the shape of VCD spectrum typical for the random coil structure was preserved. As follows from the uv-vis absorption and fluorescence spectra, porphyrin molecules are attached to peptides by electrostatic interaction as a monomer or dimer and interaction between porphyrin and peptide depends on the polypeptide chain length. For the PLGA-TMPyP system with PLGA containing from tens to hundreds of glutamic acid residues in the chain, the VCD spectra were unchanged when TMPyP was presented in the aqueous solution of PLGA and random coil conformation of PLGA-TMPyP aggregates was preserved.",

abstract="Rational control of the cooperativity of multiple noncovalent interactions often plays an important role in the design and construction of supramolecular self-assemblies and materials, especially in precision supramolecular engineering. However, it still remains a challenge to control the cooperativity of multiple noncovalent interactions through tuning the hydrophobic effect. In this work, we demonstrate that the binding cooperativity of cucurbit[8]uril(CB[8])-mediated homoternary complexes is strongly influenced by the amphiphilicity of guest molecule side groups on account of an interplay between both classical (entropy-driven) and nonclassical (enthalpy-driven) hydrophobic effects. To this end, we rationally designed and prepared a series of guest molecules bearing a benzyl group as the CB[8] homoternary binding motif with various hydrophilic and hydrophobic side groups for cooperative control. By gradually tuning side groups of the guest molecules from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, we are able to control the binding from positive to negative cooperativity. An advanced molecular recognition process and self-assembling system can be developed by adjusting the positive and negative cooperativity. The ability to regulate and control the binding cooperativity will enrich the field of supramolecular chemistry, and employing cooperativity-controlled multiple noncovalent interactions in precision supramolecular engineering is highly anticipated.",

abstract="An experimental and computational investigation of amido-thiourea promoted imine hydrocyanation has revealed a new and unexpected mechanism of catalysis. Rather than direct activation of the imine by the thiourea, as had been proposed previously in related systems, the data are consistent with a mechanism involving catalyst-promoted proton transfer from hydrogen isocyanide to imine to generate diastereomeric iminium/cyanide ion pairs that are bound to catalyst through multiple noncovalent interactions; these ion pairs collapse to form the enantiomeric $\alpha$-aminonitrile products. This mechanistic proposal is supported by the observation of a statistically significant correlation between experimental and calculated enantioselectivities induced by eight different catalysts (P << 0.01). The computed models reveal a basis for enantioselectivity that involves multiple stabilizing and destabilizing interactions between substrate and catalyst, including thiourea-cyanide and amide-iminium interactions.",

abstract="We report an intriguing noncovalent interaction of thioflavin T (ThT), a fibril diagnostic dye, with the versatile macrocyclic host molecule cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) in the presence of metal cations. ThT forms both 1:1 (CB7$\cdot$ThT) and 2:1 [(CB7)2$\cdot$ThT] complexes with CB7 host, leading to specific structural arrangements. Addition of competitive guests like metal cations to the 1:1 stoichiometric complex displays expected competitive binding interactions with CB7, leading to decreased fluorescence intensity from ThT. However, addition of metal ions to the 2:1 complex leads to unusual enhancement in the fluorescence emission (\~{}270-fold in the presence of Ca2+ and \~{}160-fold in the presence of Na+). These contrasting observations on the fluorescence enhancement with change in the stoichiometric equilibrium have been investigated explicitly for a feasible binding model. Detailed photophysical characterization with supporting data from NMR and anisotropy measurements has led to the revelation of a novel stimulus-responsive cooperative metal ion binding to the stoichiometrically selected (CB7)2$\cdot$ThT complex, demonstrating a highly fluorescent supramolecular nanocapsule. The first example of a noncovalently packed fluorescent complex became feasible due to the structural arrangement of the host-guest complex in the 2:1 stoichiometry with two CB7 portals providing strong negative charge density for the metal ions to group and seal the complex, thus protecting the incorporated dye. To further strengthen the usefulness of the supramolecular capsule established here, rupture of the capsular complex has been demonstrated with a strong competitive guest, 1-amantadine hydrochloride, which helped in disrupting the capsule to release the dye. It is proposed here that by judicious design of the chromophore (guest) structure, such capsular assemblies can be explored for the binding and release of drug molecules, for fluorescence on-off systems, and as building blocks for molecular architectures displaying unique properties.",

Solid-state emissions of 1 and 6 are dependent on their crystallinity. Reversible and selective vapoluminescence was observed for 1 and 6 in the presence of chlorocarbon vapors. For solid 1, dramatic enhancement of green luminescence is observed upon sorption of CH2Cl2 or CHCl3 vapor. The excimeric orange emission for solid 6 is switched to monomeric green emission upon exposure to CH2Cl2 vapor. The luminescent responses of a thin film of 1 towards various organic vapors have also been examined. In the crystallographically determined structure of 1.CH2Cl2, the bis(acetylide) moiety acts as the receptor berth for a CH2Cl2 molecule through concerted C[BOND]H...$\pi$(C[TRIPLE BOND]C) interactions, while Cl...Cl interactions connect the CH2Cl2 molecules into infinite linear chains. The observed crystal lattices are arranged into scaffolds of varying porosity by weak C[BOND]H...N(py) (1.CH2Cl2, 1.CH3CN, 4.DMF) and C[BOND]H...F[BOND]C (6, 6.CH3CN) interactions. The correlation between the crystal structures of 1.CH2Cl2, 1.CH3CN, 2, 4.DMF, 5, 6, and 6.CH3CN and their vapoluminescence suggests that weak nonconventional hydrogen-bonding interactions preside over the reversible sensing and signalling processes.",

abstract="The random phase approximation (RPA) is an increasingly popular post-Kohn-Sham correlation method, but its high computational cost has limited molecular applications to systems with few atoms. Here we present an efficient implementation of RPA correlation energies based on a combination of resolution of the identity (RI) and imaginary frequency integration techniques. We show that the RI approximation to four-index electron repulsion integrals leads to a variational upper bound to the exact RPA correlation energy if the Coulomb metric is used. Auxiliary basis sets optimized for second-order Moller--Plesset (MP2) calculations are well suitable for RPA, as is demonstrated for the HEAT [A. Tajti et al., J. Chem. Phys. 121, 11599 (2004)] and MOLEKEL [F. Weigend et al., Chem. Phys. Lett. 294, 143 (1998)] benchmark sets. Using imaginary frequency integration rather than diagonalization to compute the matrix square root necessary for RPA, evaluation of the RPA correlation energy requires O(N(4) log N) operations and O(N(3)) storage only; the price for this dramatic improvement over existing algorithms is a numerical quadrature. We propose a numerical integration scheme that is exact in the two-orbital case and converges exponentially with the number of grid points. For most systems, 30-40 grid points yield muH accuracy in triple zeta basis sets, but much larger grids are necessary for small gap systems. The lowest-order approximation to the present method is a post-Kohn-Sham frequency-domain version of opposite-spin Laplace-transform RI-MP2 [J. Jung et al., Phys. Rev. B 70, 205107 (2004)]. Timings for polyacenes with up to 30 atoms show speed-ups of two orders of magnitude over previous implementations. The present approach makes it possible to routinely compute RPA correlation energies of systems well beyond 100 atoms, as is demonstrated for the octapeptide angiotensin II.",

J. 2012, 18, 9955-9964) is extended to 30 complexes (S30L), featuring more diverse interaction motifs, anions, and higher charges (-1 up to +4) as well as larger systems with up to 200 atoms. Various typical noncovalent interactions like hydrogen and halogen bonding, pi-pi stacking, nonpolar dispersion, and CH-pi and cation-dipolar interactions are represented by {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}real{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} complexes. The experimental Gibbs free energies of association (DeltaGa exp) cover a wide range from -0.7 to -24.7 kcal mol-1. In order to obtain a theoretical best estimate for DeltaGa, we test various dispersion corrected density functionals in combination with quadruple-zeta basis sets for calculating the association energies in the gas phase. Further, modern semiempirical methods are employed to obtain the thermostatistical corrections from energy to Gibbs free energy, and the COSMO-RS model with several parametrizations as well as the SMD model are used to include solvation contributions. We investigate the effect of including counterions for the charged systems (S30L-CI), which is found to overall improve the results. Our best method combination consists of PW6B95-D3 (for neutral and charged systems) or omegaB97X-D3 (for systems with counterions) energies, HF-3c thermostatistical corrections, and Gibbs free energies of solvation obtained with the COSMO-RS 2012 parameters for nonpolar solvents and 2013-fine for water. This combination gives a mean absolute deviation for DeltaGa of only 2.4 kcal mol-1 (S30L) and 2.1 kcal mol-1 (S30L-CI), with a mean deviation of almost zero compared to experiment. Regarding the relative Gibbs free energies of association for the 13 pairs of complexes which share the same host, the correct trend in binding affinities could be reproduced except for two cases. The MAD compared to experiment amounts to 1.2 kcal mol-1, and the MD is almost zero. The best-estimate theoretical corrections are used to back-correct the experimental DeltaGa values in order to get an empirical estimate for the {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}experimental{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright}, zero-point vibrational energy exclusive, gas phase binding energies. These are then utilized to benchmark the performance of various {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}lowcost{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} quantum chemical methods for noncovalent interactions in large systems. The performance of other common DFT methods as well as the use of semiempirical methods for structure optimizations is discussed.",

abstract="The basis set convergence of energy differences obtained from the random phase approximation (RPA) to the correlation energy is investigated for a wide range of molecular interactions. For dispersion bound systems the basis set incompleteness error is most pronounced, as shown for the S22 benchmark [P. Jurecka et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 8, 1985 (2006)10.1039/b600027d]. The use of very large basis sets (> quintuple-zeta) or extrapolation to the complete basis set (CBS) limit is necessary to obtain a reliable estimate of the binding energy for these systems. Counterpoise corrected results converge to the same CBS limit, but counterpoise correction without extrapolation is insufficient. Core-valence correlations do not play a significant role. For medium- and short-range correlation, quadruple-zeta results are essentially converged, as demonstrated for relative alkane conformer energies, reaction energies dominated by intramolecular dispersion, isomerization energies, and reaction energies of small organic molecules. Except for weakly bound systems, diffuse augmentation almost universally slows down basis set convergence. For most RPA applications, quadruple-zeta valence basis sets offer a good balance between accuracy and efficiency.",

abstract="The equilibrium association free enthalpies DeltaG(a) for typical supramolecular complexes in solution are calculated by ab initio quantum chemical methods. Ten neutral and three positively charged complexes with experimental DeltaG(a) values in the range 0 to -21 kcal mol(-1) (on average -6 kcal mol(-1)) are investigated. The theoretical approach employs a (nondynamic) single-structure model, but computes the various energy terms accurately without any special empirical adjustments. Dispersion corrected density functional theory (DFT-D3) with extended basis sets (triple-zeta and quadruple-zeta quality) is used to determine structures and gas-phase interaction energies (DeltaE), the COSMO-RS continuum solvation model (based on DFT data) provides solvation free enthalpies and the remaining ro-vibrational enthalpic/entropic contributions are obtained from harmonic frequency calculations. Low-lying vibrational modes are treated by a free-rotor approximation. The accurate account of London dispersion interactions is mandatory with contributions in the range -5 to -60 kcal mol(-1) (up to 200\% of DeltaE). Inclusion of three-body dispersion effects improves the results considerably. A semilocal (TPSS) and a hybrid density functional (PW6B95) have been tested. Although the DeltaG(a) values result as a sum of individually large terms with opposite sign (DeltaE vs. solvation and entropy change), the approach provides unprecedented accuracy for DeltaG(a) values with errors of only 2 kcal mol(-1) on average. Relative affinities for different guests inside the same host are always obtained correctly. The procedure is suggested as a predictive tool in supramolecular chemistry and can be applied routinely to semirigid systems with 300-400 atoms. The various contributions to binding and enthalpy-entropy compensations are discussed.",

    abstract="A new model, termed D4, for the efficient computation of molecular dipole-dipole dispersion coefficients is presented. As in the related, well established D3 scheme, these are obtained as a sum of atom-in-molecule dispersion coefficients over atom pairs. Both models make use of dynamic polarizabilities obtained from first-principles time-dependent density functional theory calculations for atoms in different chemical environments employing fractional atomic coordination numbers for interpolation. Different from the D3 model, the coefficients are obtained on-the-fly by numerical Casimir-Polder integration of the dynamic, atomic polarizabilities alpha(iomega). Most importantly, electronic density information is now incorporated via atomic partial charges computed at a semi-empirical quantum mechanical tight-binding level, which is used to scale the polarizabilities. Extended statistical measures show that errors for dispersion coefficients with the proposed D4 method are significantly lower than with D3 and other, computationally more involved schemes. Alongside, accurate isotropic charge and hybridization dependent, atom-in-molecule static polarizabilities are obtained with an unprecedented efficiency. Damping function parameters are provided for three standard density functionals, i.e., TPSS, PBE0, and B3LYP, allowing evaluation of the new DFT-D4 model for common non-covalent interaction energy benchmark sets.",

abstract="A new test set (S12L) containing 12 supramolecular noncovalently bound complexes is presented and used to evaluate seven different methods to account for dispersion in DFT (DFT-D3, DFT-D2, DFT-NL, XDM, dDsC, TS-vdW, M06-L) at different basis set levels against experimental, back-corrected reference energies. This allows conclusions about the performance of each method in an explorative research setting on {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}real-life{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} problems. Most DFT methods show satisfactory performance but, due to the largeness of the complexes, almost always require an explicit correction for the nonadditive Axilrod-Teller-Muto three-body dispersion interaction to get accurate results. The necessity of using a method capable of accounting for dispersion is clearly demonstrated in that the two-body dispersion contributions are on the order of 20-150\% of the total interaction energy. MP2 and some variants thereof are shown to be insufficient for this while a few tested D3-corrected semiempirical MO methods perform reasonably well. Overall, we suggest the use of this benchmark set as a {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}sanity check{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} against overfitting to too small molecular cases.",

abstract="In quantum chemical computations the combination of Hartree-Fock or a density functional theory (DFT) approximation with relatively small atomic orbital basis sets of double-zeta quality is still widely used, for example, in the popular B3LYP/6-31G* approach. In this Review, we critically analyze the two main sources of error in such computations, that is, the basis set superposition error on the one hand and the missing London dispersion interactions on the other. We review various strategies to correct those errors and present exemplary calculations on mainly noncovalently bound systems of widely varying size. Energies and geometries of small dimers, large supramolecular complexes, and molecular crystals are covered. We conclude that it is not justified to rely on fortunate error compensation, as the main inconsistencies can be cured by modern correction schemes which clearly outperform the plain mean-field methods.",
