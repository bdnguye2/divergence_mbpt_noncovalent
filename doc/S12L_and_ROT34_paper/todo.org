* Computing binding energies for S30L rather than the older and smaller S12L.
  (using consistent types of basis sets)
* Including coronene dimer (http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00268970903397249).
* Assessing, at least for one example, the effect of GKS-RPA.
* DONE Composing a useful supporting information containing the raw data, all checked for correctness.
* Improving the presentation.
